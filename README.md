# Optimization of Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier
Support vector machine (SVM) is one of the most popular classifer which deals with the classification and regression problem with strong generalization capabilities. Optimization of SVM can be done by tuning of SVM parameters.

#### Optimization 
- Optimization is done by
- -------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- tuning the following kernel type:
     - SVM-linear
     - SVM-polynomial 
     - SVM-RBF (Gaussian radial basis function) 
     - SVM- sigmoid

- Tuning of C and gamma hyperparameter

      'C': np.logspace(-3, 2, 5), 'gamma': np.logspace(-3, 2, 5)
- 8 fold Grid search cross validation

Figure 1.1. Confusion matrix of Support Vector Machine (SVM) without optimization.

Here,

- 44 patients are predicted correctly without heart disease.

- 11 patients are wrongly predicted without heart disease.

- 12 patients are wrongly predicted with heart disease.

- 55 patients are predicted correctly with heart disease.

Decision boundary has been generated by taking first two features and by ploting the training points.

##### Other Optimization techniques include:
- Random optimization
- Bayesian optimization
